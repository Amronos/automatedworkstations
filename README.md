Adds vanilla-themed automatic workstations similar to the crafter. Currently adds an automatic smithing table called the smither.

## Smither
- An automatic smithing table.
- All input slots can be separately disabled.
- Outputs a comparator signal of 1 for every input slot that has an item in it or is disabled.
- When it receives a redstone signal it ejects the result obtained from the input slots. By placing another container block in front of it will make it eject the result into that container.
- Items can be put in it with blocks like a hopper, dropper, crafter, another smither, etc.
